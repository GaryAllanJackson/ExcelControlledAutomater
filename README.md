Excel is used to describe the action, selector_type, selector, expected value, actual value and description for each action.
A separate Excel application, Commands.xlsm, that is not included with this application, due to source controls limiting its alter-ability, is used to create separate Excel files(CommandScripts.xlsx) 
that are used by the application to perform one or more actions.
An additional Excel file, TestLogs.xlsx, with a single Sheet entitled Logs, also not included, serves as the LogFile for the application.

At the time of this writing, Actions in the Commands.xlsm and CommandScripts.xlsx files consist of the following Commands and similar but not exact Descriptions:  (Descriptions listed below are more robust for general understanding.)
